## 🧠 Home AI Stack

I’ve built a collaborative debugging and orchestration system using five specialized AI models:

- **Gemini** – Orchestrator
- **Grok** – Creative Intelligence
- **GitHub Copilot** – Coder
- **Claude** – Integration Specialist
- **Cline** – Tester

Together, they form a multi-agent system for solving complex problems and debugging collaboratively.

## 🔐 Innovation: Base-Prime Encryption

Inventor of **Base-Prime**, a ternary coding and encryption method operating on 2/3/5 logic.  
- 2 and 5 exist in superposition  
- Designed for binary systems with optimal progression to ternary/trinary systems 
- Enables novel data encoding and security paradigms
- Quantum ready, quantum secure
